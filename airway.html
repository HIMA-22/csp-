  <p> An <b>airplane or aeroplane</b> (informally plane) is a fixed-wing aircraft that is propelled forward by thrust from a jet engine, propeller, or rocket engine. Airplanes come in a variety of sizes, shapes, 
        and wing configurations. The broad spectrum of uses for airplanes includes recreation, transportation of 
        <img src="a1.jpg"  alt="Airplane" align="right" height="260" width="460"> goods and people, military, and research. Worldwide, commercial aviation transports more than four billion 
        passengers annually on airliners and transports more than 200 billion tonne-kilometers of cargo annually, 
        which is less than 1% of the world's cargo movement. Most airplanes are flown by a pilot on board the 
        aircraft, but some are designed to be remotely or computer-controlled such as drones.</p>
      <p>The Wright brothers invented and flew the first airplane in 1903, recognized as "the first sustained 
        and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight". They built on the works of George Cayley dating from 
        1799, when he set forth the concept of the modern airplane (and later built and flew models and successful 
        passenger-carrying gliders) and the work of German pioneer of human aviation Otto Lilienthal, who, 
        between 1867 and 1896, also studied heavier-than-air flight. Lilienthal's flight attempts in 1891 are seen as 
        the beginning of human flight. Following its limited use in World War I, aircraft technology continued to 
        develop. Airplanes had a presence in all the major battles of World War II. The first jet aircraft was the 
        German Heinkel He 178 in 1939. The first jet airliner, the de Havilland Comet, was introduced in 1952. 
        The Boeing 707, the first widely successful commercial jet, was in commercial service for more than 50 
        years, from 1958 to at least 2013.

        <p>First attested in English in the late 19th century (prior to the first sustained powered flight), the 
            word airplane, like aeroplane, derives from the French aéroplane, which comes from the Greek ἀήρ (aēr), "
            air" and either Latin planus, "level", "wandering". "Aéroplane" originally  referred just to the wing, as it is 
            a plane moving through the air. In an example of synecdoche, the word for 
            the wing came to refer to the entire aircraft.

                In the United States and Canada, the term "airplane" is used for powered fixed-wing aircraft. In the 
United Kingdom and most of the Commonwealth, the term "aeroplane" (is usually applied to these aircraft.
The Frenchman Clement Ader constructed his first of three flying machines in 1886, the Éole. It was a bat-
like design run by a lightweight steam engine of his own invention, with four cylinders developing

20 horsepower (15 kW), driving a four-blade propeller. The engine weighed no more than 4 kilograms per 
kilowatt (6.6 lb/hp). The wings had a span of 14 m (46 ft). All-up weight was 300 kilograms (660 lb). On 9 
October 1890, Ader attempted to fly the Éole. Aviation historians give credit to this effort as a powered 
take-off and uncontrolled hop of approximately 50 m (160 ft) at a height of approximately 200 mm 
(7.9 in). Ader's two subsequent machines were not documented to have achieved flight

    The American Wright brothers flights in 1903 are recognized by the Fédération Aéronautique 
Internationale (FAI), the standard-setting and record-keeping body for aeronautics, as "the first sustained 
and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight". By 1905, the Wright Flyer III was capable of fully 
controllable, stable flight for substantial periods. The Wright brothers credited Otto Lilienthal as a major 
inspiration for their decision to pursue manned flight.

In 1906, the Brazilian Alberto Santos-Dumont made what was claimed to be the first airplane flight 
unassisted by catapult and set the first world record recognized by the Aéro-Club de France by flying 220 
meters (720 ft) in less than 22 seconds. This flight was also certified by the FAI.

<p>World War I served as a testbed for the use of the airplane as a weapon. Airplanes demonstrated their 
    potential as mobile observation platforms, then proved themselves to be machines of war capable of causing 
    casualties to the enemy. The earliest known aerial victory with a synchronized machine gun-armed fighter 
    aircraft occurred in 1915, by German Luftstreitkräfte Leutnant Kurt Wintgens. Fighter aces appeared; the 
    greatest (by number of Aerial Combat victories) was Manfred von Richthofen.</p>

    When risk is measured by deaths per passenger kilometer, air travel is approximately 10 times safer 
    than travel by bus or rail. However, when using the deaths per journey statistic, air travel is significantly 
    more dangerous than car, rail, or bus travel. Air travel insurance is relatively expensive for this reason—
    insurers generally use the deaths per journey statistic. There is a significant difference between the safety of 
    airliners and that of smaller private planes, with the per-mile statistic indicating that airliners are 8.3 times 
    safer than smaller planes. 
    Like all activities involving combustion, fossil-fuel-powered aircraft release soot and other pollutants 
    into the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) are also produced. In addition, there 
    are environmental impacts specific to airplanes: for instance,
    </p>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li> Airplanes operating at high altitudes near the tropopause (mainly large jet airliners) emit aerosols 
            and leave contrails, both of which can increase cirrus cloud formation – cloud cover may have 
            increased by up to 0.2% since the birth of aviation
            </li>
            <li>	Airplanes operating at high altitudes near the tropopause can also release chemicals that interact 
                with greenhouse gases at those altitudes, particularly nitrogen compounds, which interact with 
                ozone, increasing ozone concentrations
                </li>
                <li> 	Most light piston aircraft burn avgas, which contains tetraethyllead (TEL). Some lower-
                    compression piston engines can operate on unleaded mogas and turbine engines and diesel 
                    engines – neither of which require lead – are used on some newer light aircraft. Some non-
                    polluting light electric aircraft are already in production.
                    </li>
                    <li>Another environmental impact of airplanes is noise pollution, mainly caused by aircraft taking off and 
                        landing.
                        </li>
