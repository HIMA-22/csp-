        <P>A <b>raft</b> is any flat structure for support or transportation over water. It is usually of basic design, 
        characterized by the absence of a hull. Rafts are usually kept afloat by using any combination of buoyant 
        materials such as wood, sealed barrels, or inflated air chambers (such as pontoons), and are typically not 
        propelled by an engine. Rafts are an ancient mode of transport; naturally-occurring rafts such as entwined 
        vegetation and pieces of wood have been used to traverse water since the dawn of humanity.</P>

       <p>Traditional or primitive rafts were constructed of wood or reeds. Modern rafts may also 
        use pontoons, drums, or extruded polystyrene blocks. Inflatable rafts up to the 20th century used 
        flotation chambers made of goat- or buffalo-skins, but most now[when?] use durable, multi-layered rubberized 
        fabrics. Depending on its use and size, it may have a superstructure, masts, or rudders.
        
        Timber rafting is used by the logging industry for the transportation of logs, by tying them together into rafts 
        and drifting or pulling them down a river. This method was very common up until the middle of 
        the 20th century but is now used only rarely.</p>
        
           <p> Large rafts made of balsa logs and using sails for navigation were important in maritime trade on the 
        Pacific Ocean coast of South America from pre-Columbian times until the 19th century. Voyages were made 
        to locations as far away as Mexico, and many trans-Pacific voyages using replicas of ancient rafts have been 
        undertaken to demonstrate possible contacts between South America and Polynesia. 
        The type of raft used for recreational rafting is almost exclusively an inflatable raft, manufactured of flexible 
        materials for use on white water. In biology, particularly in island biogeography, non-manmade rafts are an 
        important concept. Such rafts consist of matted clumps of vegetation that has been swept off the dry land by 
        a storm, tsunami, tide, earthquake or similar event; in modern times they sometimes also incorporate 
        other kind of flotsam and jetsam, e.g. plastic containers. They stay afloat by its natural buoyancy and can 
        travel for hundreds, even thousands of miles and are ultimately destroyed by wave action 
        and decomposition, or make landfall. <br>
        <br>
        Rafting events are important means of oceanic dispersal for non-flying animals. For 
        small mammals, amphibians and reptiles in particular, but for many invertebrates as well, such rafts of 
        vegetation are often the only means by which they could reach and – if they are lucky – 
        colonize oceanic islands before human-built vehicles provided another mode of transport. </p>
