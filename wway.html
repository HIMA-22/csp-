    <p>After Homo erectus possibly using watercraft more than a million years ago crossing straits between 
        landmasses, boats have served as transportation far into the pre-historic. Circumstantial evidence, such as 
        the early settlement of Australia over 40,000 years ago,

          findings in Crete dated 130,000 years ago, and 
          
    
        in Flores dated to 900,000 years ago, suggest that boats have been used since prehistoric times. The earliest 
        boats are thought to have been dugouts, and the oldest boats found by archaeological excavation date from 
        around 7,000â€“10,000 years ago. The oldest recovered boat in the world, the Pesse canoe, found in 
        the Netherlands, is a dugout made from the hollowed tree trunk of a Pinus sylvestris that was constructed 
        somewhere between 8200 and 7600 BC. This canoe is exhibited in the Drents Museum in Assen, 
       
        Netherlands. Other very old dugout boats have also been recovered. Rafts have. operated for at least 8,000 
        years. A 7,000-year-old seagoing reed boat has been found at site H3 in Kuwait.  Boats were used between 
        4000 and 3000 BC in Sumer, ancient Egypt[ and in the Indian Ocean. </p><br>
        Boats can be categorized into three main types:

              <li><a href="btype2.html" target="_blank">Sailboat</a></li>
              <li><a href="btype3.html" target="_blank">Motorboats</a></li>

            </ul>
           
     <p>
        Boats played an important role in the commerce between      the         Indus           Valley            civilizatios 
        and Mesopotamia.  Evidence of varying models of boats has also been discovered at various Indus Valley 
        archaeological sites. Uru craft originate in Beypore, a village in south Calicut, Kerala, in southwestern India. 
        This type of mammoth wooden ship was constructed solely of teak, with a transport capacity of 400 tonnes. 
        The ancient Arabs and Greeks used such boats as trading vessels. </font>

        <p>A<strong> water taxi or a water bus</strong> is a watercraft used to provide public or private transport, usually, but not 
          always, in an urban environment. Service may be scheduled with multiple stops, operating in a similar 
          manner to a bus, or on demand to many locations, 
          <img src="wbus.jpg" alt="A water bus" align="right" width="450" height="340">
          operating in a similar manner to a taxi. A boat service 
          shuttling between two points would normally be described as a ferry rather than a water bus or taxi.

          <p>Until the mid-19th century most boats were made of natural materials, primarily wood, although reed, bark 
            and animal skins were also used. Early boats include the bound-reed style of boat seen in Ancient Egypt, 
            the birch bark canoe, the animal hide-covered kayak and coracle and the dugout canoe made from a single 
            log. By the mid-19th century, many boats had been built with iron or steel frames but still planked in wood. 
            In 1855 ferro-cement boat construction was patented by the French, who coined the name "ferciment". This 
            is a system by which a steel or iron wire framework is built in the shape of a boat's hull and covered over 
            with cement. Reinforced with bulkheads and other internal structure it is strong but heavy, easily repaired, 
            and, if sealed properly, will not leak or corrode. </p>
            
                 <p> As the forests of Britain and Europe continued to be over-harvested to supply the keels of larger wooden 
            boats, and the Bessemer process (patented in 1855) cheapened the cost of steel, steel ships and boats began 
            to be more common. By the 1930s boats built entirely of steel from frames to plating were seen replacing 
            wooden boats in many industrial uses and fishing fleets. Private recreational boats of steel remain 
            uncommon. In 1895 WH Mullins produced steel boats of galvanized iron and by 1930 became the world's 
            largest producer of pleasure boats. Mullins also offered boats in aluminum from 1895 through 1899 and 
            once again in the 1920s, but it wasn't until the mid-20th century that aluminium gained widespread 
            popularity. Though much more expensive than steel, aluminum alloys exist that do not corrode in salt water, 
            allowing a similar load carrying capacity to steel at much less weight.
